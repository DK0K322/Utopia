# Installation and Setup

Installation of Utopia is simple. You can find a basic platform-wide installation and setup process just below. If you are using replit, the corresponding installation and setup guide is a little bit farther down.

## Setup Buttons

## Basic Setup Guide
To setup this app on a platform of your choice, either:

a) Click the corresponding setup button above or,<br>b) Run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DK0K322/Utopia --recursive
$ cd Utopia
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Replit Setup Guide
To setup on Replit, first click on the "Run on Replit" button in the [setup buttons](#setup-buttons) section. After loading into your repl, click on the green "Run" button. Alternatively, run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DK0K322/Utopia
$ npm install
$ chmod +x main.sh
$ ./main.sh
```

You will only have to run the second command once. It just allows `main.sh` to be executed. By running `main.sh`, you will update any submodules and will start the app.
